I have uploaded my code for my partner to animate my SVG Icons.  
My symbol definitions can be found in *icons/symbol-defs.svg*.

# + Addition by Erina Chavez

As part of this assignment, I was tasked with editing a classmate's icons with custom animations. Thus, I forked [chrismolina159's](https://github.com/chrismolina159/Drawing-on-the-Web) repo, and added gradient and line animations.
